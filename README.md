# YouTubeOpenAPI
OpenAPI bindings for YouTube (and YouTube Music) internal API, also called InnerTube.

# Usage
This is using YML syntax to specify responses and requests, defined by the [OpenAPI spec](https://www.openapis.org/).

You can transcompile (auto-generate bindings) this YML file to practicaly any programming language. You should use [swagger-codegen](https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-codegen), as I personally had issues with [openapi-generator](https://openapi-generator.tech/).

# License

It's freely available to everyone without any specific restrictions. I also don't restrict how you use bindings and how you license them, but all I want is just a little credit to me - example `Thanks to @mytja for YouTubeOpenAPI` or copyright example `Copyright (c) 2022 mytja`.

Due to MIT restriction, you should include copy of license when building your own project that uses this project.

# Disclaimer

I will not restrict anybody from how are you using this project, just note that [YouTube ToS](https://www.youtube.com/static?template=terms) might.
Please comply with YouTube ToS.
